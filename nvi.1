.nf
Downloads Node.js and makes the node and npm executables available in a
separate directory. The specifics of which version of Node.js, the directory
containing Node.js, the directory containing the executables, and the
temporary directory storing the tar archive frome nodejs.org are all
configurable using options flags.

.nf
nvi saves executable files on your disk, which lets you put these files on
the $PATH and refer to them in CI environments where bash functions and
other popular ways of providing node runtimes are cumbersome to work with.

Operational (will affect the installation)
\-d, \-\-download\-directory
    Make nvi store the temporary tar (which is later removed) in this
    directory. Defaults to $PWD.
\-e, \-\-executable\-directory
    Make nvi link the node and npm executables in this directory. Defaults
    to $HOME/.local/bin.
\-i, \-\-install\-directory
    Make nvi unpack the Node.js tar in this directory. Defaults to
    $HOME/.local. This is not removed as the executables need it.
\-n, \-\-node\-version
    Make nvi install this version of Node.js. Defaults to reading
    ./package.json and using the value of the property .engines.node.

.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
The examples range from very explicit to very implicit. Each option can be
omitted, which in most cases just use a conservative fallback that should be
safe. In the case of the Node.js version, however, the fallback is to read
\&./package.json to infer the version based on the property .engines.node.
If you are specifying your Node.js version in some other way, you will have
to explicitly pass the version you want using \-\-node\-version.

nvm (https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
    A popular tool for managing Node.js versions during development. This
    provides a lot more functionality in the "managing" section, but exposes
    everything as bash functions, which can cause headaches in CI
    environments. If your main concern is managing Node.js versions in your
    local bash sessions on your own machine, this could be worth looking
    into.
